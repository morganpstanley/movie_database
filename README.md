# Movie_Database

This is a project I worked on for the Software Development Course at Flatiron. It uses a combination of Ruby on Rails and HTML to make a simple movie database where users can add movies to their own collection, or view other users collections. 

## Can I Use the Movie_Database?
Because this project allows users to login in through Github, loading it onto your own machine won't do much as the key and secret have not been uploaded.
